# Expense Tracker (React)

This is a simple **Expense Tracker App** built with React.  
It allows users to set a budget, add expenses, and keep track of their spending.  
The app prevents expenses from being added if they exceed the remaining budget.  
All data is stored in **LocalStorage**, so the budget and expenses remain even after refreshing the page.  
The app is also **mobile responsive**.
